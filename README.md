**Introduction**
Today is the age of informational technology. Technology has revolutionized the world. We can see the impact of technology everywhere. As technology is growing exponentially, so is the need for connectivity between these different technologies. So, our idea is to develop a web platform which helps its users to connect their different applications with each other to share information. Our users can be both, a normal person who wants to automate some process which requires information sharing between different applications or a Programmer who has developed something new and wants to create integrations with different applications. Both of these users have to just sign-up to our platform and select the applications they want to integrate with each other and just like this their applications will be integrated. This integration is what we call a PEER.

**Product**
In this era of technical advancements we come across number applications which we use on daily bases (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Email-Services, Cloud Storage services like Dropbox ) sometimes we need to combine these applications to perform some tasks. As we keep on including these applications in our daily life we come across a number of use cases in which the communication  between applications can save us a lot of time and effort. Apify enables its users to create the communication bridge between these applications and automate their processes.  For example, let’s say that your family were going to send you some holiday snaps via email, but you wanted them to be stored on your Dropbox account for safekeeping and easy access. In order to do this you will have to download all those photos from email and then upload all those photos to Dropbox which will consume a lot of time. With Apify, you can set up a PEER which will detect when you receive an email with an attachment (in this case your holiday photos) and automatically save them to your Dropbox which will save you from all the hustling & time consuming process of downloading and uploading without compromising the efficiency. There are hundreds of different uses for Apify – from sharing posts on your social media to managing your accounts and automating your emails – from connecting your business applications to managing your home automation devices. 



**Background**
At heart Apify is an Integrational platform which enables its users to create a communication bridge for different applications so that they can share the information as per user requirements. Apify works on a simple methodology of “Trigger and Action”. A trigger is a process which invokes a routine to perform a specific task and an action is a process which is invoked by a trigger. At Apify this combination of “Trigger and action” is called Peer.

A user can create multiple Peers which includes a Trigger and an Action. For example, a retailer wants to email all its customers of an offer on his e-commerce website. In this case E-commerce offer is a trigger and Email to customers is an action. Whenever this retailer puts up an offer on E-commerce a Peer will automatically tell its email application to email all the customers in the list. 

The example above uses two different applications, one is an e-commerce platform and the other is emailing software. Apify enabled its user to create communication between these applications and automate his daily process.



**Objective(s)/Aim(s)/Target(s)**
Our aim is to design a Web Application which will help users save their resources and time by automating their application synchronization by creating a simple Peer. Our project will be a great contribution for society so that everyone can use and save their precious time because we all know that time is money.



**Scope**
Users can sign-up on Apify and can create as many Peers as they want. To create a Peer user will first select a trigger application from a list of applications provided by Apify and will verify the application using its credentials after that user will select the action application again from the list of applications provided by Apify and will verify this application as well. After successful verification of both applications a Peer will be made for that particular user. This peer automatically syncs those applications as per user requirements which will save valuable time and resource allocation.
